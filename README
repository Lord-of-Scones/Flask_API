This is a python program that connects with a Docker container holding a postgresDB on my personal machine. therefore it will not run unless you have that as well.
The program's purpose is to display data that it reads in from a postgress database using sql querries, and display it through a webpage.
It also takes in values for queries through URI parameters in URL.
